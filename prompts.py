- Use **formal financial language**, as in a sell-side earnings note

- Any litigation, compliance concerns, or macroeconomic exposures mentioned
- Your final investment stance (Buy / Hold / Sell) with reasoning **only from the document**

📝 Instructions:
- DO NOT USE BULLET POINTS OR TABLES
- Write **two polished analyst-style paragraphs**, each around **100–120 words**
- Base the recommendation entirely on disclosed information — no outside assumptions
- Clearly state when critical data is absent or vague (e.g., “No ESG commentary found in the report”)
